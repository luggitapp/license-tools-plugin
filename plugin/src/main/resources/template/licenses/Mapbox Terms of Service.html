        <p>Terms of service
Welcome to the future of mapping! We're glad you're here.

This website, Mapbox.com (the "site"), is owned and operated by Mapbox, Inc. ("Mapbox", "we" or “us”). By using the site, services provided on the site, or map content we make available to you through the services (collectively, "Services"), you agree to be bound by the following Terms of Service, as updated from time to time (collectively, the "Terms"). Please read them carefully. If you don’t agree to these Terms, you may not use the Services.

Signing up
In order to use most Services, you must register for a Mapbox account. When you use our application program interfaces (APIs), each request to an API must include one of your account's unique API keys.

Please carefully guard the security of your account and monitor use of your API keys. You are responsible for all use of the Services under your account, whether or not authorized, including any use of your API keys. At our discretion, we may make limited exceptions to this policy for unauthorized use of your account if you notify us of the problem promptly.

You must be 13 years or older to use the Services. By registering as a user or providing personal information on the site, you represent that you are at least 13 years old.

If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of your company or another legal entity, you represent that you have the authority to bind that entity to these Terms, in which case "you" will mean the entity you represent.

If you are a United States government user or otherwise accessing or using any Mapbox service in a U.S. government capacity, these Terms are amended as set out in our U.S. Government Terms of Service.

Our services
Subject to these Terms, we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license and right to:

Use the Services to develop online services and online, desktop, or mobile applications;
Make the Services available to end users in connection with their use of your publicly available online services and publicly available online, desktop, or mobile applications; and
You may make static exports and prints for non-commercial purposes such as flyers, posters, or other short publications for academic, non-profit, or personal use. All static and print materials must contain the required Mapbox attribution. Commercial printing requires a custom plan, please contact our team for pricing.
You may only use the Services for non-commercial purposes, for commercial applications publicly accessible without charge, and for commercial mobile applications that are paid for exclusively through an online app store. If you are subscribed to either our Commercial or Premium Plans, you may also use the Services in private, commercial applications for up to 250 Seats. A "Seat" is a distinct end user--i.e., an actual human being--that can access an application or service you provide. Multiple users are not allowed to use the same Seat, even if they use it at different times.

You may not use the Services in connection with any application or site to track moving physical assets (e.g., personnel or vehicles) on a map, unless you have either a Commercial or a Premium plan. Tracking means to locate an asset based on latitude/longitude coordinates provided to your application via a sensor. If you subscribe to our Premium or Commercial plans, you may track up to 1000 assets.

You may access certain Mapbox hosted Valhalla APIs via the Services at the endpoint beginning with api.mapbox.com/valhalla (“Valhalla APIs”). Results from the Valhalla APIs may only be used in conjunction with a Mapbox-provided map, and may not be exported, stored or cached. We do not currently support access to the Valhalla APIs via our Mobile SDKs.

If you want to make use of the Services outside this description--such as in non-public applications, videos, or bulk print media--contact us about an Enterprise plan.

Mapping APIs
The "Mapping APIs" means the Maps API, Styles API, Static API, Static (Classic) API and Tileset API. You must access and use map tiles, static map images, style files, glyphs, and sprites that we provide to you (collectively "Map Assets”) only through our APIs.

You may temporarily cache Map Assets on end-user devices (e.g., laptops, smartphones, or tablets) for offline use, but each device must populate its cache using direct requests to the Mapping APIs and content from a cache may only be consumed by a single end user. On mobile devices, you may only cache up to the limits set in the applicable Mapbox SDK, and you may not circumvent or change those limits. You may not redistribute Map Assets, including from a cache, by proxying, or by using a screenshot or other static image instead of accessing Map Assets through the Mapping APIs. You may not scrape or download Map Assets for any purpose other than temporary offline caching on a single end user’s device.

You may use Studio or third-party software to trace Mapbox maps solely comprised of satellite imagery ("Mapbox Satellite Imagery") and produce derivative vector datasets (i) for non-commercial purposes and (ii) for OpenStreetMap. If you are on at least a Premium or Commercial plan, you may also use Studio to trace Mapbox Satellite Imagery for commercial purposes, but may only trace up to 100 points, lines, or polygons per year. Except as permitted by this paragraph, you may not trace Mapbox maps.

You must display Mapbox branding (unless specifically permitted by us in writing) and provide attribution, including an "Improve this map" link, on all maps as outlined in our documentation.

For other use cases or additional rights, please contact us about an Enterprise plan.

Geocoding API
You may only use responses from the Geocoding API ("Geocodes") in conjunction with a Mapbox map. You may not export, store or cache Geocodes. You may not resell or re-syndicate Geocodes to other publishers or third parties (except to your end users or as an integrated part of your application). You may use latitude and longitude information from Geocodes to position results on a map, but you may not display the latitudes or longitudes directly to end users. You may only query the Geocoding API in response to human user queries and human app interactions; you may not perform bulk or automated queries.

You may not use results from the Geocoding API (a) to develop a general database of locations or addresses for any neighborhood, city, state, country, or other such geographic region, or to develop any other general purpose digital map database; (b) to develop or test another geocoding application or API; (c) in connection with navigation products preinstalled or integrated into automobiles by auto manufacturers, auto electronic component manufacturers or auto system integrators; or (d) for in-flight navigation. You may not use point of interest results from the Geocoding API (a) for lead generation, advertiser targeting or advertising analysis; (b) to create or augment user profiles or audience segments based on or derived from points of interest results (including, for clarity, calculations or analysis of footfall traffic for any point of interest); or (c) for geofencing -- i.e. to give end users real-time mobile alerts or personalized content based on the end user’s current proximity to a point of interest (giving users content in response to searches or map interactions does not constitute geofencing).

Upon written notice to you, we may audit your use of the Geocoding API to ensure it is in compliance with this section. The terms of this section are intended for the direct benefit of our third party suppliers and may also be enforced directly by those suppliers.

For other use cases or additional rights, please contact us about an Enterprise plan.

Directions, Matrix, Optimization and Map Matching APIs
Results from the Directions, Matrix, Optimization and Map Matching APIs may only be used in conjunction with a Mapbox-provided map, and may not be exported, stored or cached.

For other use cases or additional rights, please contact us about an Enterprise plan.

Mapbox on mobile
To use Mapbox Services on mobile, your app must use one of the Mapbox maintained SDKs as described in our documentation (each, a "Mapbox Mobile SDK") as your exclusive means of accessing Mapbox Services supported by the SDK. At any given time, the Mapbox Mobile SDK that you use must be the version that has been released within the immediately preceding 12 months (unless no such update has been released). The Mapbox Mobile SDK you use will periodically send location and usage data (telemetry) to us, which we may use to improve our maps, provide information back to you about how your app is being used, and for other purposes consistent with our privacy policy.

For all mobile applications that use Mapbox Services, you must:

Limit use of your app to users at least 13 years of age or disable information sharing for users younger than 13.
Obtain your users' affirmative express consent before you access their location (the automatic notifications in iOS and Android suffice).
Disclose that location and usage data will be shared with Mapbox. Notification in your privacy policy is the minimum permitted, but we suggest you also offer a notification directly in your product interface the first time sharing is activated.
Allow users to opt out of location data sharing using one of the methods described in our developer documentation.
Comply with any additional local requirements related to information access or sharing.
Not interfere with or limit the data that the Mapbox Mobile SDK sends to us, whether by modifying the SDK or by other means, except as otherwise required by the Terms.
Not attempt to identify specific individuals, vehicles, or entities with which telemetry data that we provide to you via the developer dashboard is associated (e.g. by re-identifying data).
For more detail, please review our privacy policy, telemetry page, and law enforcement guidelines.

Vision SDK
“Vision SDK” means our proprietary software development kits that (1) display routing and map information on top of real-time imagery, (2) identify, classify and locate features in real-time imagery, and/or (3) have the additional capabilities included in our online documentation.

You may only use the Vision SDK in iOS and Android mobile applications. If you want to use Vision on other platforms, in embedded devices, or to obtain additional functionality, please contact sales to get an enterprise license.

You may not save, download or otherwise store or cache any content, data and/or information generated by Vision SDK. You may not use the Vision SDK to develop a general database of locations or road features for any neighborhood, city, state, country, or other such geographic region, or to develop any other general purpose digital map database. You may not distribute the Vision SDK (i) in human readable form or (ii) on a standalone basis in any form. You may only distribute the Vision SDK in compiled object code format as part of an application (a) licensed under these Terms, (ii) that you own or control and (iii) that provides significant additional functionality to the Vision SDK. You are responsible for any use of the Vision SDK by users of your licensed application(s).

By using the Vision SDK, you acknowledge that the Vision SDK will send front-facing camera imagery and derived information (the “Vision Data”). You will (i) not prevent or interfere with the Vision SDK sending the Vision Data to us and (ii) ensure that you have obtained the necessary rights for use of the Vision Data as permitted under this Agreement. You acknowledge and agree that we may, free-of-charge and without restriction, exploit and make available the Vision Data.

To the extent that you use the Android version of the Vision SDK, the following applies: Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (“QTI”) is an intended third-party beneficiary of these Terms of Service and your use of the Vision SDK does not convey or otherwise provide any rights under any patents of QTI or its affiliates.

Upon termination of your limited license to use the Vision SDK, you agree to immediately destroy all copies of the Vision SDK.

Studio
If you use the places search function provided in the Studio dataset editor to place point features on a map, you must (1) only use such features internally, (2) not resell, sublicense or share such points with any third party, and (3) only use such points in compliance with the Geocoding API terms set forth above.

Enterprise Boundaries Evaluation
In the event we give you access to our administrative level polygon vector tiles (“Enterprise Boundaries"), you shall:

only use Enterprise Boundaries for the sole purpose of internally evaluating whether to license Enterprise Boundaries from us under an enterprise agreement;
only use Enterprise Boundaries in conjunction with a Mapbox map;
not (and shall not permit any third party to) trace or otherwise derive or extract content, data and/or information from Enterprise Boundaries;
not copy, disassemble, reverse engineer (except to the limited extent such restrictions are expressly prohibited by applicable statutory law), modify or alter any part of Enterprise Boundaries; and
not use Enterprise Boundaries to test, validate or benchmark against any other product, service or dataset without our prior written consent (a “Permitted Benchmarking”); if there is a Permitted Benchmarking, you shall provide us with a summary of the results, which we may use free-of-charge and without restriction to improve our products and services.
We may terminate your access to Enterprise Boundaries at any time. Upon the termination of your access to Enterprise Boundaries, you shall immediately cease all use, and destroy all copies, of Enterprise Boundaries. Upon our written request, you shall provide us with written certification of deletion in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence.

Unlawful and other unauthorized uses
You agree to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and third party agreements in your use of the Services. You are not (and are not 50% or more owned by one or more individuals, organization or entities that are): (1) organized or located in a country or territory that is the target of sanctions imposed or (2) listed on any restricted or sanctioned party list maintained by the U.S. Government or any other country.

You may not use the Services in any manner that could damage or overburden the Services or interfere with any other party's use of the Services.

You may not use the Services to:

Disseminate material that is abusive, obscene, pornographic, defamatory, harassing, grossly offensive, vulgar, threatening, or malicious;
Aid or implementing practices violating basic human rights or civil liberties. For the avoidance of doubt, you may not use the Services to assist in the creation of databases of identifying information for any government to abrogate any human rights, civil rights, or civil liberties of individuals on the basis of race, gender or gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, or national origin;
Disseminate or store material that infringes the copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, or other intellectual property right of any person;
Create a false identity or otherwise attempting to mislead others as to the identity or origin of any communication;
Export, re-export, or permit downloading of any content in violation of any export or import law, regulation, or restriction of the United States and its agencies or authorities, or without all required approvals, licenses, or exemptions;
Interfere with or attempt to gain unauthorized access to any computer network;
Host with, transmit to or provide to us any information that is subject to specific government regulation, including, without limitation, Protected Health Information (as defined in the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended), financial information (as regulated by the U.S. Financial Services Modernization Act, as amended), consumer reports and consumer-reporting information (as regulated by the U.S. Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended) and information subject to export control or economic sanction laws;
Operate dangerous businesses such as emergency services or air traffic control, where the use or failure of the Services could lead to death, personal injury or significant property damage;
Transmit viruses, trojan horses, or any other malicious code or program; or
Engage in any other activity reasonably deemed by Mapbox to be in conflict with the spirit or intent of these Terms.
You may not modify, create derivative works from, reverse engineer, or attempt to derive any source code from the site’s software, except as expressly permitted by a written license from us. Further, unless expressly prohibited under applicable law, you may not use the Services to develop, test, validate and/or improve any service or dataset that is a substitute for, or substantially similar to, the Services (including any portion thereof).

End users and notification
You may not allow your end users or other third parties to use the Services in any way that would be a violation of these Terms if done by you, and you agree to take reasonable efforts to prevent such use. You agree to promptly notify Mapbox in writing if you become aware of any misappropriation or unauthorized use of the Services.

Documentation
In addition to the requirements above, you agree to adhere to the policies posted on this site in conjunction with the Services, including accompanying documentation. Those policies are incorporated by reference into these Terms.

Charges and payment
Some of the Services require payment. We may charge your credit card on an ongoing basis in advance of providing Services or as needed for prepayments for your subscription fee, any applicable sales taxes, and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of Mapbox Services. The subscription fee is billed in full on the first day of each billing period, unless and until you cancel your subscription.

Sometimes even you don't know how popular your maps are going to be. If your account exceeds the map views allowed by your plan, we may charge you overage fees at the end of your billing period. Overage rates vary by plan. You agree to pay overage fees for all usage including requests that result from unexpected traffic.

We are not responsible for any bank fees, interest charges, finance charges, over draft charges, or other fees resulting from charges billed by Mapbox. Currency exchange settlements will be based on agreements between you and the provider of your credit card.

All charges are non-refundable unless expressly stated otherwise, or otherwise provided by applicable law.

Ownership
Your content
You retain ownership of all content that you contribute to the Services via Mapbox Studio, Mapbox Studio Classic, the Dataset API and the Uploads API, excluding any content that you receive from Mapbox ("Your Content").

Limited to the purpose of hosting Your Content so that we can provide the Services to you, you hereby grant Mapbox a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up, transferable and sublicensable right and license to use, copy, cache, publish, display, distribute, modify, create derivative works, and store Your Content and to allow others to do so.

During the term of this agreement, you hereby grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid-up, transferable and sublicensable license to use your trademarks, service marks, and logos for the purpose of identifying you as a Mapbox customer to promote and market our services. But if you prefer we not use your logo or name in a particular way, just let us know, and we will respect that.

Account cancellation or suspension
We don't want you to leave, but you may cancel at any time. However, we do not give pro-rated refunds for unused time if you cancel during the middle of a billing cycle.

If you breach any of these Terms, we may immediately without notice cancel or suspend your account and the limited license granted to you hereunder automaticallly terminates, without notice to you. Upon termination of the limited license, you agree to immediately destroy any materials downloaded from the Services. In addition, Mapbox may cancel or suspend your account for any reason by providing you 30 days' advance notice.

Changes to services or terms
We may modify these Terms and other terms related to your use of the Services (like our privacy policy) from time to time, by posting the changed terms on the site. All changes will be effective immediately upon posting to the site unless they specify a later date. Changes will not apply retroactively.

We may change the features and functions of the Services, including APIs. It is your responsibility to ensure that calls or requests you makes to the Services are compatible with then-current Mapbox APIs. We attempt to avoid changes to our APIs that are not backwards compatible, but such changes may occasionally be required. If that happens, we will use reasonable efforts to notify you prior to deploying the changes.
